# Very host-specific, non-generalizable. If Mailman were to run on a host where another service also needed PostgreSQL,
# this would not be appropriate. But for Mailman, we want to keep everything contained on one volume that can be easily
# attached to another instance.
#
# Warning:
#
#  Once {{ mailman3_pgdata }} exists, this will never run again, so if you attached the volume to another instance you
#  need to install 75ansible_pgdata.conf yourself.
#
# Note to future self:
#
#  I played around a bit with making a new cluster but to be safe you'd have to slurp the assigned port out of the new
#  cluster's postgresql.conf and set it as a fact for use in the django settings template and natefoo.postgresql_objects
#  and that just seemed like overkill for a special case like this.
